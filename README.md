## Introduction
Swift has been tasked to help Storslysia manage exposure to displacement risk arising from catastrophic climate-related events. Storslysia is a diverse country with different geographic regions subject to different threats due to catastrophic climate-related events which means residents of high-threat areas are at risk of permanent displacement. 

We have been hired to design a social insurance program to manage exposure to catastrophic climate-related events and impacts of mass displacement. Our proposed program focuses on proactive, voluntary relocation and involuntary relocation into lower risk areas, as by undertaking relocation, hazard risk is reduced rather than merely transferred to insurance companies and the government.


### Main Objectives
The proposed social insurance program has two main objectives:

1.	Incentivise voluntary relocation for individuals currently living in high-risk regions to move into lower risk regions.

2.	Provide support to individuals facing property damage arising from hazards, covering either involuntary relocation costs or rebuilding costs and incentivizing relocation to lower risk regions for these individuals.

These two objectives work together in reducing the impacts of displacement from climate-related catastrophes for the residents of Storslysia.

The performance of the program is measured and monitored through key metrics including participation rate, cost effectiveness and impact on vulnerable populations (full metrics and explanations in Appendix 6). These metrics will be continuously monitored over time, with the reporting frequency which reviews the program once every calendar year to ensure the program is still achieving its main objectives sustainably and equitably. 

Through thorough analysis, design, modelling and implementation, Swift found that the implementation of the Social Insurance Program:

1.	Reduced costs across different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) emission scenarios up to 21% in the short-term (up to 2025)

2.	Reduced costs across different SSP emission scenarios up to 39% in the longer term (up to 2050)

3.	Maintained costs under 10% GDP for all SSP Scenarios up to 2050

Further research and monitoring are recommended to maintain the programâ€™s effectiveness.

## Assumptions
The proposed social insurance program has two main objectives:

1.	Incentivise voluntary relocation for individuals currently living in high-risk regions to move into lower risk regions.

2.	Provide support to individuals facing property damage arising from hazards, covering either involuntary relocation costs or rebuilding costs and incentivizing relocation to lower risk regions for these individuals.

These two objectives work together in reducing the impacts of displacement from climate-related catastrophes for the residents of Storslysia.
